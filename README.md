## My process

  - Use existing knowledge
  - Explore things, find out how they work
  - Existing knowledge + Apply Explored things
  
### Built with
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
- How Flexbox works
- How CSS Grid works
- We can use id in \<br>(ex: \<br id="xyz">)
- We can create \<br> using CSS (How? Check: https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-a-line-break-using-css)
- Android don't support .svg files(I moved project files to Android>check index.html>Images didn't show up)

### Continued development

I choosed a simple challenge from frontendmentor. I will try to complete more challenges. My strategy will be to go easiest to complex challenges. 

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com/) - This helped me for exploring things. I really liked this pattern to find things that I don't know. 
- [w3schools Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept(Read text, find out how code works, edit the code to check different behaviors, use the code).
- [w3schools CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - It helped me to understand css grid.
